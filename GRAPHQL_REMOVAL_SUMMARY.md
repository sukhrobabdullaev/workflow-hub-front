# GraphQL Removal Summary

## Changes Made

### Removed Files

- `src/pages/ProjectsGraphQL.tsx` - GraphQL-specific projects page
- `src/hooks/useProjectsGraphQL.ts` - GraphQL hooks
- `src/components/modals/CreateProjectModalGraphQL.tsx` - GraphQL create modal
- `src/components/modals/EditProjectModalNew.tsx` - GraphQL edit modal (unused)
- `src/lib/graphql/` - Entire GraphQL directory and schemas
- `src/lib/apollo-client.ts` - Apollo Client configuration
- `src/lib/adapters/project-adapter.ts` - GraphQL to store adapters

### Updated Files

#### `src/App.tsx`

- Removed Apollo Provider and GraphQL imports
- Removed `/projects-graphql` route
- Simplified app structure to use only React Query for API calls

#### `src/pages/Projects.tsx`

- Replaced API hooks with direct store usage
- Removed loading/error states (using mock data)
- Removed GraphQL version link
- Updated project operations to use store methods directly
- Simplified delete confirmation logic

#### `src/components/modals/CreateProjectModal.tsx`

- Replaced `useCreateProject` API hook with `useAppStore`
- Added loading state management
- Updated form submission to use store's `addProject` method
- Added simulated delay for better UX

#### `src/components/modals/EditProjectModal.tsx`

- Replaced API hooks with store methods
- Updated to use `updateProject` and `deleteProject` from store
- Added loading state management
- Improved error handling

#### `src/store/appStore.ts`

- Enhanced mock data with 8 projects instead of 6
- Updated project dates to be more current (2025)
- Added more diverse project statuses and descriptions
- Improved project variety for better testing

## Current State

The projects functionality now uses **only mock data** from the Zustand store:

1. **No API calls** - All operations are local
2. **No GraphQL dependencies** - Clean removal of all GraphQL code
3. **Enhanced mock data** - More realistic and diverse project portfolio
4. **Consistent UX** - Maintained loading states and error handling patterns
5. **Fully functional** - Create, read, update, delete operations work with store

## Benefits

1. **Simplified Architecture** - No need for complex API integration
2. **Faster Development** - No waiting for API responses
3. **Offline Capable** - Works without internet connection
4. **Predictable Data** - Consistent mock data for testing
5. **Easy Customization** - Simple to modify mock data for different scenarios

## Testing

The application should now:

- ✅ Display projects from mock data
- ✅ Allow creating new projects
- ✅ Support editing existing projects
- ✅ Enable project deletion (with task validation)
- ✅ Show realistic loading states
- ✅ Provide proper error handling
- ✅ Maintain responsive UI

All projects functionality is now completely independent of external APIs and uses local mock data exclusively.
