## üìã Development Workflow

### Branch Naming Convention

- `feature/description` - New features
- `bugfix/description` - Bug fixes
- `hotfix/description` - Critical fixes
- `chore/description` - Maintenance tasks
- `docs/description` - Documentation updates

### Commit Message Format

We follow the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) specification:

```
<type>[optional scope]: <description>

[optional body]

[optional footer(s)]
```

**Types:**

- `feat`: A new feature
- `fix`: A bug fix
- `docs`: Documentation only changes
- `style`: Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code
- `refactor`: A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
- `perf`: A code change that improves performance
- `test`: Adding missing tests or correcting existing tests
- `chore`: Changes to the build process or auxiliary tools

**Examples:**

```
feat(auth): add two-factor authentication
fix(dashboard): resolve data loading issue
docs: update API documentation
style: format code according to prettier rules
```

## üß™ Testing

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
npm test

# Run tests with coverage
npm run test:coverage

# Run tests in watch mode
npm run test:watch

# Run tests with UI
npm run test:ui
```

### Writing Tests

- Write tests for all new features and bug fixes
- Place test files next to the source files with `.test.tsx` or `.spec.tsx` extension
- Use descriptive test names that explain what is being tested
- Follow the AAA pattern: Arrange, Act, Assert

### Test Coverage Requirements

- Maintain minimum 80% code coverage
- All new features must include tests
- Bug fixes must include regression tests

## üé® Code Style

### ESLint and Prettier

Our project uses ESLint and Prettier for code formatting and linting:

```bash
# Check linting
npm run lint

# Fix linting issues
npm run lint:fix

# Check formatting
npm run format:check

# Format code
npm run format
```

### Code Style Guidelines

- Use TypeScript for all new code
- Follow React functional component patterns with hooks
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Add JSDoc comments for complex functions
- Keep functions small and focused
- Use absolute imports with the `@/` alias

### Component Guidelines

- Use PascalCase for component names
- Export components as named exports
- Include proper TypeScript interfaces for props
- Use React.memo() for performance optimization when appropriate

## üìö Documentation

- Update README.md if your changes affect setup or usage
- Add JSDoc comments for new functions and components
- Update type definitions when modifying interfaces
- Include examples in documentation when helpful

## üîÑ Pull Request Process

### Before Submitting
